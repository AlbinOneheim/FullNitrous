            because i wanted to make a game and i continued to work on programming other stuff because a group i got invited
            to never finished their project so i wanted to just make a part. Then continuing to work on a company so i can earn
            money for that initial part i wanted to become reality from that dead project group.

              There is basically nothing here, this is a void in my life. I didn't do much at all besides playing video games on the playstation 2 like
              ratchet and clank, crash bandicoot ect. I also was also approaching my peak autism levels. It's the retarded era in my life. Though it was
              kind of fun. Throwing around CDs in the computer room at my school and getting banned until the next year. Good shit.

              Deviating from my brainlet ways
            </h3>
            
            <p>
              So being a brainlet, drooling overmyself and everyone else sure is fun but now i wanted to make a game. I began by watching some bullshit 
              tutorials on youtube and on the unity game engine. The furthest i got from that was to create a very very badly designed map. No game logic,
              no character, nothing. I also got exposed to the blender 3d modeller but i never had the real motivation to actually learn about it.
            </p>

            <p>
              I soon learned how programs, games and basically anything on the computer is made. I got exposed to coding / programming and from that point
              on i really wanted to learn programming since then i could be able to make desktop applications, games and so on. I went to the library... for 
              the first time and loaned a book on c# programming. Holy fuck that shit is cancer, even back then when i only learned about it. To be fair 
              i was quite the brainlet but forced objection orientation in the first language you learn is never a good idea. But i didn't know what the fuck
              an object even was at that time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Also worth mentioning is that i started to learn GIMP for image editing and also sony vegas for video editing.

            <h3>
              Continuing programming
            </h3>
            <p>
              I don't think i ever finished the c# book but i learned the basic and most imporant concepts of programming that is pretty much universial. Stuff as
              loops, if statements, libraries, functions, variables and so on. This also made me start to think more logically and lay out what i wanted to do
              in small instructions. 
            </p>

            <p>
              By pure chance i found a programming book that my mom used in university about programming in Python3. I don't think i even knew about the language
              at the time but i was like fuck it. Here is free material to learn another language so why not. I started reading the book and it was easier this 
              time when i had the foundation that c# gave me. But now i actually remembered a lot of the language. I various things in python as playing around 
              with primitive graphics, gui applications, basic scripts. Stuff that i actually made and liked and also sometimes used. At this point of my life
              i knew about Python, kinda forgot c# (sorry all c# devs, lol sike that language is trash).
            </p>

            <p>
              Later on i read about programming in Python and it being quite slow. I noticed this as well when writing something that ran a large chunk of 
              code in a loop or when i wanted to fill my desktop with files. That's when i decided to buy a book on C. It was quite fucking expensive actually
              but kinda worth it because now i understood more low level concepts like pointers, memory allocation and so on. That wasn't intuitive to me 
              from the beginning but after reading a bit in the book and playing around with the language i started to begin understanding them.

              Some weird robot or something
            </h3>
            <p>
              So while i was just in class one of my teachers wanted to talk to me so i went out to talk. He wanted me to join a project where I and
              some others would basically design, program and construct a humanoid robot. Me being me, I was fucking happy as fuck and said yes. We
              in the group worked on this project for a while but uh... It wasn't exactly moving on or progressing in any kind of way. I learned quite
              a lot about blender because i made some 3d models of the robot frame ect but again nothing went to actual use. Though one of the guys 
              in the group sort of introduced me to the linux termina, i already knew some commands but stuff like ssh was completely new to me. Also
              tools for monitoring the wireless network.

            <h3>
              Started working for real
            </h3>
            <p>
              After working in that group regarding the robot i was quite pissed of that nobody did anything in the group. Because i actually really 
              wanted to make the robot thing work. Unfortunatly i was retarded in thinking i and 2 more could ever make a function humanoid robot in
              such a short time span. Well, after discussing with one member of the group he decided to leave since he said that he had other things
              to do but. In reality it was probably just because he tought we were retards. Rightfully so though.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              After telling the second guy to come back to the group because this time i proposed to only make a robotic arm controlled by a client 
              computer. He still didn't believe that we could do that and he probably thought it was going to be a waste of time. Now what i did was 
              basically just fuck him off as a friend and a member in the group which was very stupid. I decided that i was going to develop this arm
              on my own and build it then show it to him as like "look ur fucking gay and i made this shit gtfo lol". 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              So i decided to start on programming the computer of the robot arm which i did with a nodemcu and a atmega328p. The atmega controlled some 
              stepper motors and the nodemcu sent i2c data to the atmega to tell it what to do. For example turn this motor this many times or something 
              in that fashion. Just for you that don't know a nodemcu and a atmega328p are board chip microprocesor units. Usually smaller than a the 
              typical finger. Anyways from coding these microcontrollers with the arduino IDE i learned C++ and it was quite easy since i already knew 
              C. Now is the time i began to learn about html, css and js. This is because the nodemcu had a webserver that the client would go on to 
              to control the arm and this was written in html, css and js. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Now when i was basically done with the robot arm computer, circuit ect i knew i couldn't go on further. Because i couldn't manufacture the
              actual parts of the arm like gears, arms ect. So after some time the progression on this project slowed down and it eventually died down.
            </p>

            <p>
              For some time i didn't really work on anything but then i thought about creating a rubber ducky / malduino type usb stick but with a screen
              and the options to select the file to output and to also use it as a storage device. I created a prototype and i also started to make a gui 
              appliction in qt which really got me programming in c++ but then i scrapped all of that. I remade it once more but this time i stopped halfway
              on the development because i needed a website to sell this. That's when i bought the domain <a href = "https://voidzehn.com">voidzehn.com</a>
              and after much frustration with web dev stuff. I learned php and more advanced js, css.

            <p>
              I continued to improve on the <a href = "https://voidzehn.com">voidzehn</a> website for a while until i implemented a social networking 
              and a chat system to the website. I needed to store data in a efficient way i needed to store alot of data so i started another project
              to make a database that could do that. Now i know you probably think I'm retarded for not using something that already exists but hey.
              It's more programming for me so whatever. I intially started the database i named <a href = "https://saturndb.com">SaturnDB</a> in php
              but then i quickly switched to writing it in C. This time also with a server builtin you could remotely connect to it and not have to 
              include it in the current script where you wanted to interact with the database. Also this meant that data could be stored on a remote
              server. And as of now that I'm writing this, that is still what i'm working on.
